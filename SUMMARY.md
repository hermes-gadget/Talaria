# Composer UX implementation summary

## What changed

- Added a per-tab composer queue. Text submitted during an active turn is retained, counted in the composer row, and drained FIFO after the authoritative `message.complete` event (with the reading-mode transcript fallback).
- Added per-session input history with ↑/↓ navigation, draft restoration, a 50-entry cap, and SharedPreferences/JSON persistence following the existing settings pattern.
- Added a chat-header steer/trigger popover for model selection, reasoning effort, approval mode, and YOLO. The model action reuses the existing model picker; session-only controls explain and remain disabled until Hermes assigns a session.
- Added pure queue/history unit coverage.

## Dashboard paths investigated

- `GET /api/status`, `/api/model/info`, `/api/model/options`, `/api/config`, and `/api/config/schema`.
- WebSocket `ws://127.0.0.1:9119/api/ws?token=local&profile=default`, including `commands.catalog` and `config.set`.
- The wired RPC keys are `reasoning` and `yolo` per session, and `approval_mode` globally; model selection continues to use the existing `model` config path.
- `session.info` state is consumed from sidecar events; direct `session.info` and `model.info` request RPCs are not exposed by the live v0.19.1 gateway.

## Verification

- Command: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:compileDebugKotlin --no-daemon`
- Result: passed (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, 30 actionable tasks).

## Leftovers

- Approval mode is global in the current Hermes server, so the popover labels it accordingly. No requested server-side control was found to be unsupported; reasoning and YOLO are disabled only while a tab has no active/resumable session.

## Widget + PiP chat

Branch: `feature/widget-pip`

- Added a 4-column Glance quick-entry widget with `New chat` and `Talk` deep-link buttons. The chat link carries a composer-focus hint; `Talk` routes to the existing connection screen.
- Added `PipChatActivity`, an explicit read-only snapshot contract, PiP lifecycle handling, and a header-only PiP action in `ChatScreen`.
- Added unit coverage for widget deep-link intents, PiP state transitions, and snapshot intent round-tripping.
- Preserved the existing Glance status widget, edge-to-edge setup, `adjustResize`, composer, and steer popover behavior.

Verification: `JAVA_HOME=/home/ben/java ANDROID_HOME=/home/ben/android-sdk ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:compileDebugKotlin --no-daemon` — passed.

## Themes parity wave

- Branch: `feature/themes`
- Added six data-driven presets: Dark (default), Light, Solarized, Nord, Dracula, and Gruvbox. Each exposes complete dark/light Material 3 schemes plus a monochrome accent variant.
- Added the Manage → Themes destination with instant preset selection, `theme_preset` persistence, live swatch previews, and process-local server color overrides.
- Backend probe (Hermes v0.19.1, read-only): `GET /api/skin` returned 404. `GET /api/config` returned `dashboard.theme = mono` and `display.skin = default`, but no supported `primary`, `accent`, or `background` fields. The UI therefore keeps “Sync from server” disabled with an explanatory note while retaining a config parser/mapping path for compatible servers.
- Added unit coverage for preset lookup/completeness and SettingsStore persistence round-trip.
- Verification: `JAVA_HOME=/home/ben/java ANDROID_HOME=/home/ben/android-sdk ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:compileDebugKotlin --no-daemon` passed.
